# BioBigData

## Machine learning for image recongization

The whole code can be found in ``.py``.

---

### Interactive interface

See ``.ipynb`` for interactive interface and visual graphics. 

**Note:** 

---

### Accruacy

We can generate the model using ``.py``, which is 
``model.pkl``, the **Train Accuracy** of the model is $\%$, and the **Test  Accuracy** is $\%$. 

*See ``.out`` to see the accuracy for each epoch. The accuracy in ``.ipynb`` is not the final result.*

#### APPENDIX

This project is run using ``High-performance computing cluster`` Ï€ of **SJTU**. 
See ``.slurm`` for the script for submit calculation task.
